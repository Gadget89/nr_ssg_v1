  title: Why Kaldi
  description: >
    Kaldi is the coffee store for everyone who believes that great coffee
    shouldn't just taste good, it should do good too. We source all of our beans
    directly from small scale sustainable farmers and make sure part of the
    profits are reinvested in their communities.

  Kaldi is the ultimate spot for coffee lovers who want to learn about their
  java’s origin and support the farmers that grew it. We take coffee production,
  roasting and brewing seriously and we’re glad to pass that knowledge to
  anyone.

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
